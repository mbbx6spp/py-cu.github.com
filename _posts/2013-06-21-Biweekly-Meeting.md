Come join us at the Champaign Public Library, in the Foundation Conference Room (Room 222, second floor), 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM. 

Agenda:
* Lightning Talks: Will be mainly led by Nadia who will talk about introspection with builtins like getattr(), type(), dir(), etc.
* GAMES (likely cards against humanity, fluxx, or some awesome card game)
* Birds of a Feather breakout sessions.
* And probably going out for drinks after!


#### Breakout Sessions
We will break out into various sessions, based on interests of the people present. This week, we will either do this at the library or whichever bar or cafe we decide to visit when the library closes.
